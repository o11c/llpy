LLPY root package. Most of the interesting stuff is in llpy.core.

Some edge cases in LLPY can be controlled by environment variables or by
calling functions in this module. The functions here can only be used
before the interesting modules are imported.

All use of these functions is subject to change without notice. Once the
proper data is filled in and remaining wrappers and testcases are written,
they will no longer be necessary, except when new LLVM APIs are written.
