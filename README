Pure Python3 bindings for LLVM.

These are a set of pure python bindings for LLVM. They will eventually be
independent of the LLVM release.

Currently, only Linux is supported, though porting is probably as simple
as changing the library filenames.

Python2 support is feasible, but would be complicated due to the int/long
and str/unicode problems.
