Pure Python3 bindings for LLVM.

These are a set of pure python bindings for LLVM. You can use them with
whatever version of LLVM and Python are installed on the user's system,
instead of having to build NxM python C extensions.

Currently, only Linux is supported, though porting is probably as simple
as changing the library filenames. Debian and Ubuntu are the most tested.

Python2 seems to be working too, though obviously you have to be more
careful about strings and ints.

Current status:
  - Supports Python 2.7 or Python 3.2 or later, and Pypy in both modes.
  - Full safe wrappers for IR generation and writing.
  - Raw bindings to all C APIs available.
