Pure Python3 bindings for LLVM.

These are a set of pure python bindings for LLVM. You can use them with
whatever version of LLVM is installed on the user's system, instead of
having to build NxM python C extensions.

Currently, only Linux is supported, though porting is probably as simple
as changing the library filenames. Debian and Ubuntu are the most tested.

Python2 support is feasible, but would be complicated due to the int/long
and str/unicode problems.
