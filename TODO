Bugs in the LLVM C API:
  - Attribute.NonLazyBind
Shortcomings of the LLVM C API:
  - documentation, whitespace
  - instruction flags: nsw, nuw, inbounds ...
  - ConstDataSequential subclasses
  - Attributes beyond 32 bits
  - Attributes for function return value (not function)
  - real predicates
Shortcomings based on insufficient LLVM documentation:
  - metadata
  - x86_mmx
  - BuildStructGEP
Shortcomings based on sheer laziness:
  - several of the @untested remaining in core.py
Shortcomings based on difficulty and scope:
  - verify the type of all arguments, so that it won't ever crash
